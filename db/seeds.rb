Quote.create(quip: "What makes a great endurance athlete is the ability to absorb potenial embarrassment, and to suffer without complaint. I was discovering that if it was a matter of gritting my teeth, not caring how it looked, and outlasting everybody else, I won. It didn't seem to matter what sport it was--in a straight-ahead, long-distant race, I could beat anybody. If it was a suffer-fest, I was good at it. -Lance Armstrong")

An elusive combination, attainable but not sustainable. -David Walsh | Inside the Tour de France.")
